        <h2>History of the Titanic</h2>
        <p>The RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on 15 April 1912 after striking an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died, making it one of modern history's deadliest peacetime commercial marine disasters.</p>

        <h2>Construction of the Titanic</h2>
        <p>The Titanic was built by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast. It was the largest ship afloat at the time it entered service and was the second of three Olympic-class ocean liners operated by the White Star Line. The Titanic was built with advanced safety features, such as watertight compartments and remotely activated watertight doors, but it carried only enough lifeboats for 1,178 peopleâ€”about half of the number on board.</p>

        <h2>The Maiden Voyage</h2>
        <p>The Titanic's maiden voyage began on 10 April 1912. After leaving Southampton, England, the ship called at Cherbourg in France and Queenstown (now Cobh) in Ireland before heading west to New York. On board were some of the wealthiest people in the world, as well as hundreds of emigrants from Great Britain, Ireland, Scandinavia, and elsewhere seeking a new life in North America.</p>

        <h2>The Disaster</h2>
        <p>On 14 April 1912, four days into the crossing and about 375 miles (600 km) south of Newfoundland, the Titanic hit an iceberg at 11:40 p.m. ship's time. The collision caused the hull plates to buckle inwards in a number of locations on the starboard side and opened five of the sixteen watertight compartments to the sea; the ship gradually filled with water. Meanwhile, passengers and some crew members were evacuated in lifeboats, many of which were launched only partially loaded. A disproportionate number of men were left aboard because of a "women and children first" protocol followed by some of the officers loading the lifeboats.</p>
        <p>At 2:20 a.m., the ship broke apart and foundered, with well over one thousand passengers and crew still aboard. Just under two hours after Titanic sank, the Cunard liner RMS Carpathia arrived and brought aboard an estimated 705 survivors.</p>

      <h2>Legacy</h2>
      <p>The wreck of the Titanic was discovered in 1985, and it remains a powerful symbol of the hubris of the early 20th century and the fragility of human endeavors. The story of the Titanic has been adapted into numerous books, films, and documentaries, most notably the 1997 film "Titanic" directed by James Cameron.</p>
