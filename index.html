                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <img src="headshot.jpeg" alt="A good looking dude!" class="responsive-img">
                <p><strong>Age:</strong> 23</p>
                <p><strong>Location:</strong> Minnesota</p>
                <p><strong>Major:</strong> Creative Design and Technology</p>
                <p><strong>Passions:</strong> Cars, Photography, Sports, Lake Life</p>
                <p>I'm a creative design and technology student at the University of Colorado Boulder, blending my passion for innovative design with a unique background that spans both digital and physical realms. With roots in mechanical work and a current focus on technology, I bring a versatile skill set that bridges software development and hands-on fabrication, reflecting my love for understanding how things are built and designed.</p>
                <p>I have a deep appreciation for creativity and connection â€“ whether I'm exploring my passions for cars, sports, movies, or spending time with animals. Beyond my technical skills, I'm driven by a dream of one day owning my own company designing aquariums, a goal that embodies my entrepreneurial spirit and love for creating immersive, beautiful spaces. At my core, I'm known for being kind, easy-going, and funny, with a genuine commitment to inclusivity and accessibility that guides both my personal interactions and professional aspirations.</p>
                <p>My goal is to create digital and physical experiences that are both functional and beautiful, with a focus on accessibility and universal design. I believe that technology should be inclusive and accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities or circumstances. I'm excited to continue learning and growing in the field of design and technology, and I'm always looking for new opportunities to collaborate and create meaningful work.</p>
