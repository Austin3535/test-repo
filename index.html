                <p>The M156 is the first automobile V8 engine designed autonomously by Mercedes-Benz subsidiary Mercedes-AMG, as previous AMG engines have always been based on original Mercedes engines. The engine was designed to be a naturally aspirated racing unit, and is also used in a number of high-performance AMG-badged Mercedes-Benz models. The engine was designed by Bernd Ramler, famed for the design of the Porsche Carrera GT's 5.7-liter V-10 engine.</p>

                <h2>M156</h2>
                <p>The M156 displaces 6,208 cc (6.2 L; 378.8 cu in) and shares very little with other Mercedes-Benz engine families like the M155. The bore spacing, block design, and other features are unique to the AMG engine.</p>
                <p>Although this engine displaces 6.2 litres, it is marketed as the "6.3" to commemorate Mercedes' famed 6.3 L M100 engine, its first production V8.</p>

                <p>When introduced in the 2007 CLK 63 AMG, output was 475 hp (482 PS; 354 kW) at 6,800 rpm with 630 N⋅m (465 lb⋅ft) of torque at 5,200 rpm. For the 2007 CLS 63 and E 63, output was 507 hp (514 PS; 378 kW) at 6,800 rpm with 630 N⋅m (465 lb⋅ft) of torque at 5,200 rpm. The 2007 ML 63 had 503 hp (510 PS; 375 kW), and the 2008 C 63 had 451 hp (457 PS; 336 kW). The final 2013–2015 C 63 AMG Edition 507 had 500 hp (507 PS; 373 kW).</p>

                <p>The engine was later uprated to produce 518 hp (525 PS; 386 kW) and 465 lb⋅ft (630 N⋅m) of torque in the late S 63, E 63, SL 63 & CL 63 models.</p>

                <h2>M156 Lawsuit</h2>
                <p>In 2011, a class action lawsuit was filed in United States District Court in New Jersey against Daimler AG, Mercedes-Benz, Mercedes-AMG for alleged defects in the M156 engine contained in AMG vehicles built in 2007–2011 model years leading to premature wear. The plaintiff claimed the combination of cast nodular iron camshafts and 9310 grade steel valve lifters contributed to the premature wear, but the defendants had known about the defect since 2007.</p>
                <p>The lawsuit lasted approximately 14-months. In November, 2012, litigation came to a halt when the New Jersey District Court dismissed the plaintiffs' first amended complaint for lack of standing. The plaintiffs were given the opportunity to further amend their complaint to show that they had standing to sue, but plaintiffs made no further filings with the Court. On January 7, 2013, the Court signed an order closing the case.</p>
